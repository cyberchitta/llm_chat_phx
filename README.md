LLM Chat is an Elixir Phoenix LiveView application providing an LLM-driven chat interface. Users can engage in multi-turn conversations with LLMs and manage chat history. The UI is styled with DaisyUI, and is closely modeled on the Chat GPT UX.

This app has been built with significant support from Claude 3 Opus and ChatGPT 4o. However, every line of code, with the notable exception of HTML/CSS markup, has been human curated (by me ðŸ˜‡).
